Last week I worked on making an experiment to make a collapse and text on click and expand text on click which I will be adding 
to my project. Another experiment was my first experiment with SVG. This experiment consists of a circle of radius 15 and a revolving
triangle around the circle. This experiment can also be implemented onto where I show all planets revolving
around the sun. But as of now I dont intend to do that. I will continue to make my experiments in relation to the project.
I also met professor Rasala last week and got my project approved which will now focus only on the solar system. Most of the
data will be coming from ESA's website, NASA, nineplanets and youtube.
