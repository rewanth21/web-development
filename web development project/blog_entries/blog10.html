This week I spent time reviewing my experiments and making some modifications to my home page. For the experiments,
I added code snippets and some missing source code links. I made some changes to my homepage by adding some effects
to my menu bar. I fixed some of the experiments which were not working. Week 2 experiment images were not working earlier, I
fixed that issue. Some of the source code links are still broken which I will be fixing soon.
