Last week I familiarized myself with Bootstrap. I created a page which has a navigation
tab and when it is resized, the right hand corner shows a bar which can be pressed to expand.
I also included some buttons and instructions to show the basic functionality of Bootstrap.
In the coming weeks I intend to work on this experiment to make modifications. This
site can be viewed on Tablet, Desktops and Mobile phones. Also fixed the issue of placing
experiments into weeks.
