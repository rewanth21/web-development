Last week I did some reading on Jquery from w3schools and dynamicdrive. Since I haven't done much
of Jquery,it took me a while to go through some concepts and implement them into my experiments. Apart
from this I have started to make a basic layout of what my website will look like. Hopefully I'll be able 
to start working on my website soon
