
This week, I put up my project online, still need to work on my homepage by making it responsive and adding some more data.
Some more images need to added. I added my collapse and expand on my project homepage. When someone clicks on the Sun or
the planets it expands the particular click and clicking on something else collapses the previous click and expands
the latest content. I will probably add some more data depending on the time I have this week and review everything.
