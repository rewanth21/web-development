
This week I delved into AngularJS. I created three experiments, one which shows the text by
choosing the which content you would want to display at one particular time. The second was adding,
deleting and shuffling data. The third experiment was to add data based on certain restrictions and
also find data based on the given input. I am having some issues with the second experiment after i added
the source code. The experiment is not letting me add data nor delete any data.
 I removed the source again to revert back to its original state, made the necessary changed 
but still I was not able to fix it. Will continue to fix this issue as the day progresses.
