
After meeting my TA today regarding some questions I had based on my project which for now is an informative website, I
got home and wrote down what sort of data I could collect to showcase on my website. Some of the data that I wish to find related to 
my website are, How vast Space actually is, What does it contain. What types of galaxies exist, What is the content of some of these
galaxies, where does our galaxy exist, where do we exist etc. There is too much data available as of now but it seems to be
vague. So what I have decided is to work on a similar idea alongside this one. This idea is a smaller and a more 
accurate version of my previous which is basically related to our solar system, what planets it contains, what sort of 
atmosphere do these planets contain, how much time does it take for the light from the Sun to reach these planets etc. 
These are some of the data which I can find accurately online and could be used. I will meet with professor Rasala regarding 
these ideas and make a call based on his approval.
