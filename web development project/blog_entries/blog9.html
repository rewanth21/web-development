
This week I will work on my experiments a little differently. I intend on doing one experiment everyday. Today I did an
experiment showing a canvas changing without the need for CSS. Apart from this I have prepared a second idea for my 
project and will meet with my TA, Pruthvi to see how I can start implementing this idea and then meet professor Rasala 
next week to get his approval. My second idea follows up on my previous blog and I am certain that there will be
alot of accurate data available online. Once I get an approval from my professor I will start implementing my project.
Apart from this, since I now have a clearer picture of what my website will be about, I will start implementing my homepage
and direct it towards the project.
