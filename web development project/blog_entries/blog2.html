This week I did some basic experiments on CSS and Javascript to get the hang of them using W3schoosl.
For the following week I will do some jquery experiments.Also, I thought about some more ideas on what 
my website would be like.


Last week I did some reading on Jquery from w3schools and dynamicdrive. Since I haven't done much
of Jquery,it took me a while to go through some concepts and implement them into my experiments. Apart
from this I have started to make a basic layout of what my website will look like. Hopefully I'll be able 
to start working on my website in the next one or two weeks.
