Back to blogging after a couple of weeeks. I have been a little busy with my other course last week 
and totally forgot to blog about my porject. Speaking of the project, I haven't been idling around with it. I
was working on an experiment for the last two and a half weeks and have finally got something good to put as an experiment
and hopefully for my project homepage. I worked on creating an animated solar system using only CSS. Check out my experiments for
week 9 to see a static solar system and then the second experiement for a solar system which is animated. Since
my website is static, i thought about implementing something like this for my project. The animated version
took me about 2 weeks to complete for which i referenced quite a few websites. This was the reason i forgot to
make a blog about what i was up to over the last two weeks.
