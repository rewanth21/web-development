
This week I did an experiment with Javascript and HTML to mask images. My second experiment was a basic experiment
using AJAX and HTML to add coffee name and the drink to a list of orders. This week I will start working on scrapping
experiments and will meet my professor to discuss about my project proposal. I haven't done a lot of experiments 
this week as I have been focusing on coming up with an idea for my website.
