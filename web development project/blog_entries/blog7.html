
I met Professor Rasala this week regarding my proposal. My project for now is to show the users what space is, how 
vast it can be and what does it actually contain. I want to my website to be informative. But since this could be 
a project which has a lot of data required, it can go both ways. There can be too much data or no data at all.
I will need to look for data in related to finding galaxies in space. What do these galaxies contain. 
For eg, what is the mass of this galaxy, is it moving away from us or towards us based on blue and red shift.
These are just some of the examples though . So the professor has given me a week to go find some data to use 
in my project. If I cant find any data by the end of next week. I will abandon the project and come up with an
 other one.
