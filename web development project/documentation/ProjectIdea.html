			<h1>PROJECT IDEA</h1>
			<hr color="black" width="40% auto">
			<h3>
			When I found out that there is a project to be done at the end of the semester I was really excited and immediately looked up some senior's website in order to get an idea as to what sort of projects are being produced. 
			There were a lot of websites and some really creative stuff going on in these websites and it made me wonder if I would ever be able to do such things in this course. One common trait I noticed was there was a lot of API 
			and database usage. After a few weeks of thought regarding my project I decided to go for a project related to Space.
			
		</h3>
		<h3>
		 I chose this project because after reviewing some senior's websites I wanted to do something different from 
			what a lot of the students were doing which were related books, music, movies etc, something unique and which hasn't been done by any student over the past 2 years and I immediately remembered my visit to the Manchester Radio Telescope in Manchester,UK, 
and during that time I became interested in Cosmology. I wanted to showcase what people usually miss out during their busy days. I wanted them to ponder on the
			fact that when they look up into the night sky, they could imagine how small we actually are have the curiosity to know what is out there. Hence I decided to make a website about our Solar System and make it informative. I would like to thank Professor Rasala for giving me the opportunity to work on this idea.
