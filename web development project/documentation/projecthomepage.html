			<h1>HOMEPAGE</h1>

			<h3>
			The project Homepage gives a brief description about the Solar System. It is a single page which has a depiction of the Solar System with the Sun in the center and 
			a nine planets revolving around sun in their own orbit. To the right of this animation a brief description about the website and as you scroll down you can see 
		    all the objects in the solar system.
			
		</h3>
		<h3>
		Clicking on any of the text will expand and give a brief description of each object and then clicking on the view in detail link will lead to that particular object's page.
		This bit of effect is done with Javascript. There is an on-click function and when the click is 1 it 
                performs the action of making the content visible and after the action is performed, counter is reset.
		
		</h3>
		<h3>
		Scrolling down even further will show a brief video about the Solar System and if someone wants to back to the top of the page, clicking on the "back to top" button at the bottom 
		will take the user back to the top of the webpage.
		</h3>

		<h3>
		On the top is a menu bar which also contains all the objects in the solar system and clicking on either will redirect to that particular homepage.
