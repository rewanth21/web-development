		 I had a lot of fun developing the website, especially the solar system animation. I can easily say that it is the star of my
		 website. The amount of CSS needed for it was a lot but at the end of the day, I learnt so much.</br>
		 <br></br>
		 Some other features which I would like to add over time are:
<ul>		
		<li>Add a section for galaxies</li>
		    Include a whole new section for galaxies, add a galaxy animation and show where the Sun is located
		 <li>Add more data like some famous moons of Jupiter and Saturn</li>
		 <li>Make an animation when the cursor is over the solar system, it shows the a small data snippet over the revolving planets</li>
		 <li>Make the Solar System animation responsive</li>
