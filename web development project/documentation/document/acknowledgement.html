			CS56010: Web Development is one of the most practical and exciting courses that I have come across. It was a good experience doing different experiments every week 
			as the learning curve increases gradually during which I could better myself every week.
		</h3>
		
		<h3>
		Firstly, I would like to thank Prof. Richard Rasala for a well-structured course and for the resources provided on his homepage which were more than sufficient to help me through
		the course. I would also like to thank him for meeting me regarding my project idea twice which gave me a better idea as to how to approach building my website and what sort of data might
		be interesting to put up.
		</h3>
		
		<h3>
		Finally, I would like to thank my TA, Pruthvi Kumar who has been a constant source of encouragement and help throughout the semester. The weekly reviews helped me better my experiments and helped 
		me gain more knowledge over the weeks that came by. I also referred to some senior's websites for design and some other websites online which were of tremendous help.
		</h3>

		Thank you for a great learning experience!
