		<h2 id="solar system"><a href="homepage.html">Solar System</a></h2>
		<p>A solar system refers to a star and all the objects that travel in orbit around it. Our solar system consists of the sun - our star - eight planets and their natural satellites (such as our moon); dwarf planets; asteroids and comets. Our solar system is located in an outward spiral of the Milky Way galaxy.</p>
		</li>
	
	
		<li>
		<h2 id="sun"><a href="Sun.html">Sun</a></h2>
		<p>The Sun is a star, a hot ball of glowing gases at the heart of our solar system. Its influence extends far beyond the orbits of distant Neptune and Pluto. Without the Sun's intense energy and heat, there would be no life on Earth. And though it is special to us, there are billions of stars like our Sun scattered across the Milky Way galaxy.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="mercury"><a href="mercury.html">Mercury</a></h2>
		<p>Sun-scorched Mercury is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon. Like the Moon, Mercury has very little atmosphere to stop impacts and it is covered with craters. Mercury's dayside is super heated by the Sun, but at night temperatures drop hundreds of degrees below freezing. Ice may even exist in craters. Mercury's egg-shaped orbit takes it around the Sun every 88 days.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="venus"><a href="venus.html">Venus</a></h2>
		<p>Venus is a dim world of intense heat and volcanic activity. Similar in structure and size to Earth, Venus' thick, toxic atmosphere traps heat in a runaway 'greenhouse effect.' The scorched world has temperatures hot enough to melt lead. Glimpses below the clouds reveal volcanoes and deformed mountains. Venus spins slowly in the opposite direction of most planets.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="earth"><a href="earth.html">Earth</a></h2>
		<p>Earth is an ocean planet. Our home world's abundance of water - and life - makes it unique in our solar system. Other planets, plus a few moons, have ice, atmospheres, seasons and even weather, but only on Earth does the whole complicated mix come together in a way that encourages life - and lots of it.</p>
		</li>
		
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="mars"><a href="mars.html">Mars</a></h2>
		<p>Though details of Mars' surface are difficult to see from Earth, telescope observations show seasonally changing features and white patches at the poles. For decades, people speculated that bright and dark areas on Mars were patches of vegetation, that Mars could be a likely place for life-forms, and that water might exist in the polar caps. When the Mariner 4 spacecraft flew by Mars in 1965, many were shocked to see photographs of a bleak, cratered surface. Mars seemed to be a dead planet. Later missions, however, have shown that Mars is a complex member of the solar system and holds many mysteries yet to be solved.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="asteroid belt"><a href="asteroidbelt.html">Asteroid Belt</a></h2>
		<p>The asteroid belt is the region of the Solar System located roughly between the orbits of the planets Mars and Jupiter. It is occupied by numerous irregularly shaped bodies called asteroids or minor planets.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="jupiter"><a href="jupiter.html">Jupiter</a></h2>
		<p>The most massive planet in our solar system, with four large moons and many smaller moons, Jupiter forms a kind of miniature solar system. Jupiter resembles a star in composition. In fact, if it had been about 80 times more massive, it would have become a star rather than a planet.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="saturn"><a href="saturn.html">Saturn</a></h2>
		<p>Saturn was the most distant of the five planets known to the ancients. Like Jupiter, Saturn is made mostly of hydrogen and helium. Its volume is 755 times greater than that of Earth. Winds in the upper atmosphere reach 500 meters (1,600 feet) per second in the equatorial region. These super-fast winds, combined with heat rising from within the planet's interior, cause the yellow and gold bands visible in the atmosphere.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="uranus"><a href="uranus.html">Uranus</a></h2>
		<p>The first planet found with the aid of a telescope, Uranus was discovered in 1781 by astronomer William Herschel. The seventh planet from the Sun is so distant that it takes 84 years to complete one orbit.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="neptune"><a href="Neptune.html">Neptune</a></h2>
		<p>Nearly 4.5 billion kilometers (2.8 billion miles) from the Sun, Neptune orbits the Sun once every 165 years. It is invisible to the naked eye because of its extreme distance from Earth. Interestingly, the unusual elliptical orbit of the dwarf planet Pluto brings Pluto inside Neptune's orbit for a 20-year period out of every 248 Earth years</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="pluto"><a href="pluto.html">Pluto</a></h2>
		<p>Tiny, cold and incredibly distant, Pluto was discovered in 1930 and long considered to be the ninth planet. But after the discoveries of similar intriguing worlds even farther out, Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet. This new class of worlds may offer some of the best evidence of the origins of our solar system.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="beyond">Beyond</a></h2>
		<p>The Kuiper belt, sometimes called the Edgeworth–Kuiper belt, is a region of the Solar System beyond the planets, extending from the orbit of Neptune to approximately 50 AU from the Sun.
		After that comes the Ort Cloud.The Oort cloud is thought to comprise two regions: a spherical outer Oort cloud and a disc-shaped inner Oort cloud, or Hills cloud. Objects in the Oort cloud are largely
		composed of ices, such as water, ammonia, and methane. And then we have the heliosphere which is like a bubble shield for the sun against interstellar radiation</p>

	<br>  KUIPER BELT: </br>
	The Kuiper Belt (sometimes referred to as the Kuiper-Edgeworth Belt) is an area of the outer solar system that is 
	estimated to stretch across 20 astronomical units (AU) of space. It contains small solar system bodies made mostly 
	of ices. The ices are frozen volatiles (gases) such as methane, ammonia, nitrogen and water. It also is home to the
	known dwarf planets Pluto, Haumea and Makemake.

The Kuiper-Edgeworth Belt is named for the astronomers Gerard Kuiper, who theorized about a disk of material in the 
outer reaches of the solar system, and Kenneth Edgeworth, who had the idea that the outer solar system contained a number 
of small bodies, perhaps left over from the formation of the Sun and planets. This region of space is cold enough to 
support the existence of volatiles more easily than areas closer to the Sun.
	  
           
			  
			
      </p>	  
	  
        <p id="p1">

<br> Facts about Kuiper Belt </br>
The Kuiper Belt could contain hundreds of thousands of icy bodies that range in size from small chunks of
 ice to worldlets larger than 100 kilometres across.
<br>Astronomers have tracked most short-period comets from their origins in the Kuiper Belt. These are comets with 
orbital periods of 200 years or less.</br>
There could be more than a trillion comet nuclei in the main body of the Kuiper Belt.
</p>
   
   <p id="p1">
 <br>ORT CLOUD</br>
The Oort Cloud is an extended shell of icy objects that exist in the outermost reaches of the solar system.
It is named after astronomer Jan Oort, who first theorized its existence. The Oort Cloud is roughly spherical, 
and is the origin of most of the long-period comets that have been observed.
	</p>

	<p id="p1">
	The inner limits of the Oort Cloud begin at about 2,000 AU from the Sun. The cloud itself stretches out almost a quarter of the way to the nearest star, Proxima Centauri. 
	It is spherically shaped and consists of an outer cloud and a torus (doughnut-shaped) inner cloud.
	</p>
	
	<p id= "p1">
	
	<br>Objects in the Oort Cloud are also referred to as Trans-Neptunian objects. This name also applies to objects in
	the Kuiper Belt.</br>
Some astronomers theorize that the Sun may have captured Oort Cloud cometary material from the outer disks of other
 stars that were forming in the same nebula as our star.
<br>The Oort Cloud is a reserve of cometary nuclei that contain ices dating back to the origin of the solar system.</br>

No one knows for sure how many objects exist in the Oort Cloud, but most estimates put it at around 2 trillion.
The planetoid Sedna, discovered in 2003, is thought to be a member of the inner Oort Cloud.
	</p>
	
	<p id="p1">
	<br>Heliosphere</br>
	The heliosphere is often described as a kind of bubble that contains our solar system. This magnetic sphere, which extends beyond Pluto, is caused by the Sun’s solar winds. These winds spread out from the Sun at around 400 km/s until they hit what is known as interstellar space, which is also called local interstellar medium (LISM) or interstellar gas. Interstellar space is the space in galaxies that is unoccupied by either stars or planets.

When the solar winds hit local interstellar medium, a kind of bubble forms that prevents certain material from getting in. Thus, the heliosphere acts as a kind of shield that protects our solar system from cosmic rays, which are dangerous interstellar particles. The interaction between interstellar gas and solar winds depends on the pressure of the solar winds and properties of interstellar space, such as pressure, density, and qualities of the magnetic field. Astronomers believe that other solar systems have their own heliospheres caused by different stars.
