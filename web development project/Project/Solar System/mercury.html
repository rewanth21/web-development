	 <li>
		<h2 id="solar system"><a href="homepage.html">Solar System</a></h2>
		<p>A solar system refers to a star and all the objects that travel in orbit around it. Our solar system consists of the sun - our star - eight planets and their natural satellites (such as our moon); dwarf planets; asteroids and comets. Our solar system is located in an outward spiral of the Milky Way galaxy.</p>
		</li>
	
	
		<li>
		<h2 id="sun"><a href="Sun.html">Sun</a></h2>
		<p>The Sun is a star, a hot ball of glowing gases at the heart of our solar system. Its influence extends far beyond the orbits of distant Neptune and Pluto. Without the Sun's intense energy and heat, there would be no life on Earth. And though it is special to us, there are billions of stars like our Sun scattered across the Milky Way galaxy.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="mercury">Mercury</h2>
		<p>Sun-scorched Mercury is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon. Like the Moon, Mercury has very little atmosphere to stop impacts and it is covered with craters. Mercury's dayside is super heated by the Sun, but at night temperatures drop hundreds of degrees below freezing. Ice may even exist in craters. Mercury's egg-shaped orbit takes it around the Sun every 88 days.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="venus"><a href="venus.html">Venus</a></h2>
		<p>Venus is a dim world of intense heat and volcanic activity. Similar in structure and size to Earth, Venus' thick, toxic atmosphere traps heat in a runaway 'greenhouse effect.' The scorched world has temperatures hot enough to melt lead. Glimpses below the clouds reveal volcanoes and deformed mountains. Venus spins slowly in the opposite direction of most planets.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="earth"><a href="earth.html">Earth</a></h2>
		<p>Earth is an ocean planet. Our home world's abundance of water - and life - makes it unique in our solar system. Other planets, plus a few moons, have ice, atmospheres, seasons and even weather, but only on Earth does the whole complicated mix come together in a way that encourages life - and lots of it.</p>
		</li>
		
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="mars"><a href="mars.html">Mars</a></h2>
		<p>Though details of Mars' surface are difficult to see from Earth, telescope observations show seasonally changing features and white patches at the poles. For decades, people speculated that bright and dark areas on Mars were patches of vegetation, that Mars could be a likely place for life-forms, and that water might exist in the polar caps. When the Mariner 4 spacecraft flew by Mars in 1965, many were shocked to see photographs of a bleak, cratered surface. Mars seemed to be a dead planet. Later missions, however, have shown that Mars is a complex member of the solar system and holds many mysteries yet to be solved.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="asteroid belt"><a href="asteroidbelt.html">Asteroid Belt</a></h2>
		<p>The asteroid belt is the region of the Solar System located roughly between the orbits of the planets Mars and Jupiter. It is occupied by numerous irregularly shaped bodies called asteroids or minor planets.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="jupiter"><a href="jupiter.html">Jupiter</a></h2>
		<p>The most massive planet in our solar system, with four large moons and many smaller moons, Jupiter forms a kind of miniature solar system. Jupiter resembles a star in composition. In fact, if it had been about 80 times more massive, it would have become a star rather than a planet.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="saturn"><a href="saturn.html">Saturn</a></h2>
		<p>Saturn was the most distant of the five planets known to the ancients. Like Jupiter, Saturn is made mostly of hydrogen and helium. Its volume is 755 times greater than that of Earth. Winds in the upper atmosphere reach 500 meters (1,600 feet) per second in the equatorial region. These super-fast winds, combined with heat rising from within the planet's interior, cause the yellow and gold bands visible in the atmosphere.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="uranus"><a href="uranus.html">Uranus</a></h2>
		<p>The first planet found with the aid of a telescope, Uranus was discovered in 1781 by astronomer William Herschel. The seventh planet from the Sun is so distant that it takes 84 years to complete one orbit.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="neptune"><a href="Neptune.html">Neptune</a></h2>
		<p>Nearly 4.5 billion kilometers (2.8 billion miles) from the Sun, Neptune orbits the Sun once every 165 years. It is invisible to the naked eye because of its extreme distance from Earth. Interestingly, the unusual elliptical orbit of the dwarf planet Pluto brings Pluto inside Neptune's orbit for a 20-year period out of every 248 Earth years</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="pluto"><a href="pluto.html">Pluto</a></h2>
		<p>Tiny, cold and incredibly distant, Pluto was discovered in 1930 and long considered to be the ninth planet. But after the discoveries of similar intriguing worlds even farther out, Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet. This new class of worlds may offer some of the best evidence of the origins of our solar system.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="beyond"><a href="beyond.html">Beyond</a></h2>
		<p>The Kuiper belt, sometimes called the Edgeworth–Kuiper belt, is a region of the Solar System beyond the planets, extending from the orbit of Neptune to approximately 50 AU from the Sun.
		After that comes the Ort Cloud.The Oort cloud is thought to comprise two regions: a spherical outer Oort cloud and a disc-shaped inner Oort cloud, or Hills cloud. Objects in the Oort cloud are largely
		composed of ices, such as water, ammonia, and methane. And then we have the heliosphere which is like a bubble shield for the sun against interstellar radiation</p>

        <p id="p1">

  Mercury is the closest planet to the sun, orbiting 57,910,000 km from the Sun. It diameter is 
4880 km and its mass is 3.30e23 kgs. 
</p>

       <p id="p1">
In Roman mythology Mercury is the god of commerce, travel and thievery, the Roman 
counterpart of the Greek god Hermes, the messenger of the Gods. The planet probably 
received this name because it moves so quickly across the sky.

</p>


<p id="p1">
Mercury is the second densest planet after Earth, with a huge metallic core roughly 2,200 to 2,400
 miles (3,600 to 3,800 km) wide, or about 75 percent of the planet's diameter. In comparison, Mercury's outer 
 shell is only 300 to 400 miles (500 to 600 km) thick.

Mercury speeds around the sun every 88 Earth days, traveling through space at nearly 112,000 mph (180,000 kph),
 faster than any other planet. Its oval-shaped orbit is highly elliptical, taking Mercury as close as 29 million 
 miles (47 million km) and as far as 43 million miles (70 million km) from the sun. If one could stand on Mercury 
 when it is nearest to the sun, it would appear more than three times as large as it does when viewed from Earth.
</p>


       <p id="p1">

Mercury is the smallest planet in the solar system. Because the planet is so close to the sun, Mercury's surface 
temperature can reach 
a scorching 840 degrees Fahrenheit (450 degrees Celsius). However, since this world
doesn't have a real atmosphere to entrap any heat, at night temperatures can plummet
to minus 275 F (minus 170 C), a temperature swing of more than 1,100 
degrees F (600 degree C), the greatest in the solar system. 

Since it has no significant atmosphere to stop impacts, the planet is pockmarked with craters. 
About 4 billion years ago, an asteroid roughly 
60 miles (100 kilometers) wide struck Mercury with an impact equal to 1 trillion 
1-megaton bombs, creating a vast impact crater roughly 960 miles (1,550 km) wide.
Known as the Caloris Basin, this crater could hold the entire state of Texas. 
Another large impact may have helped create the planet’s odd spin. 
</p>

       <p id="p1">
<br>Atmospheric composition (by volume) and Internal structure </br>

No atmosphere: Mercury possesses an exosphere containing 42 percent oxygen, 29 percent sodium, 
22 percent hydrogen, 6 percent helium, 0.5 percent potassium, with possible trace amounts of argon, 
carbon dioxide, water, nitrogen, xenon, krypton and neon.



Internal structure: Iron core roughly 2,200 to 2,400 miles (3,600 to 3,800 km) wide.
 Outer silicate shell about 300 to 400 miles (500 to 600 km) thick. 


</p>
<p id="p1">
<br>Orbit & rotation:</br>

Average distance from the sun: 35,983,095 miles (57,909,175 km). By comparison: 0.38 Earth's distance from the Sun.

Perihelion (closest approach to sun): 28,580,000 miles (46,000,000 km). By comparison: 0.313 times that of Earth

Aphelion (farthest distance from sun): 43,380,000 miles (69,820,000 km). By comparison: 0.459 times that of Earth

Length of Day: 58.646 Earth-days

Even though the planet is the closest to the sun,
there has been evidence of water ice at the craters of the north pole.
