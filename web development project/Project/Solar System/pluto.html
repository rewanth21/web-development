		<h2 id="solar system"><a href="homepage.html">Solar System</a></h2>
		<p>A solar system refers to a star and all the objects that travel in orbit around it. Our solar system consists of the sun - our star - eight planets and their natural satellites (such as our moon); dwarf planets; asteroids and comets. Our solar system is located in an outward spiral of the Milky Way galaxy. </p>
		</li>
	
		<li>
		<h2 id="sun"><a href="Sun.html">Sun</a></h2>
		<p>The Sun is a star, a hot ball of glowing gases at the heart of our solar system. Its influence extends far beyond the orbits of distant Neptune and Pluto. Without the Sun's intense energy and heat, there would be no life on Earth. And though it is special to us, there are billions of stars like our Sun scattered across the Milky Way galaxy.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="mercury"><a href="mercury.html">Mercury</a></h2>
		<p>Sun-scorched Mercury is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon. Like the Moon, Mercury has very little atmosphere to stop impacts and it is covered with craters. Mercury's dayside is super heated by the Sun, but at night temperatures drop hundreds of degrees below freezing. Ice may even exist in craters. Mercury's egg-shaped orbit takes it around the Sun every 88 days.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="venus"><a href="venus.html">Venus</a></h2>
		<p>Venus is a dim world of intense heat and volcanic activity. Similar in structure and size to Earth, Venus' thick, toxic atmosphere traps heat in a runaway 'greenhouse effect.' The scorched world has temperatures hot enough to melt lead. Glimpses below the clouds reveal volcanoes and deformed mountains. Venus spins slowly in the opposite direction of most planets.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="earth"><a href="earth.html">Earth</a></h2>
		<p>Earth is an ocean planet. Our home world's abundance of water - and life - makes it unique in our solar system. Other planets, plus a few moons, have ice, atmospheres, seasons and even weather, but only on Earth does the whole complicated mix come together in a way that encourages life - and lots of it.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="mars"><a href="mars.html">Mars</a></h2>
		<p>Though details of Mars' surface are difficult to see from Earth, telescope observations show seasonally changing features and white patches at the poles. For decades, people speculated that bright and dark areas on Mars were patches of vegetation, that Mars could be a likely place for life-forms, and that water might exist in the polar caps. When the Mariner 4 spacecraft flew by Mars in 1965, many were shocked to see photographs of a bleak, cratered surface. Mars seemed to be a dead planet. Later missions, however, have shown that Mars is a complex member of the solar system and holds many mysteries yet to be solved.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="asteroid belt"><a href="asteroidbelt.html">Asteroid Belt</a></h2>
		<p>The asteroid belt is the region of the Solar System located roughly between the orbits of the planets Mars and Jupiter. It is occupied by numerous irregularly shaped bodies called asteroids or minor planets.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="jupiter"><a href="jupiter.html">Jupiter</a></h2>
		<p>The most massive planet in our solar system, with four large moons and many smaller moons, Jupiter forms a kind of miniature solar system. Jupiter resembles a star in composition. In fact, if it had been about 80 times more massive, it would have become a star rather than a planet.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="saturn"><a href="saturn.html">Saturn</a></h2>
		<p>Saturn was the most distant of the five planets known to the ancients. Like Jupiter, Saturn is made mostly of hydrogen and helium. Its volume is 755 times greater than that of Earth. Winds in the upper atmosphere reach 500 meters (1,600 feet) per second in the equatorial region. These super-fast winds, combined with heat rising from within the planet's interior, cause the yellow and gold bands visible in the atmosphere.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="uranus"><a href="uranus.html">Uranus</a></h2>
		<p>The first planet found with the aid of a telescope, Uranus was discovered in 1781 by astronomer William Herschel. The seventh planet from the Sun is so distant that it takes 84 years to complete one orbit.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="neptune"><a href="Neptune.html">Neptune</a></h2>
		<p>Nearly 4.5 billion kilometers (2.8 billion miles) from the Sun, Neptune orbits the Sun once every 165 years. It is invisible to the naked eye because of its extreme distance from Earth. Interestingly, the unusual elliptical orbit of the dwarf planet Pluto brings Pluto inside Neptune's orbit for a 20-year period out of every 248 Earth years</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="pluto">Pluto</h2>
		<p>Tiny, cold and incredibly distant, Pluto was discovered in 1930 and long considered to be the ninth planet. But after the discoveries of similar intriguing worlds even farther out, Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet. This new class of worlds may offer some of the best evidence of the origins of our solar system.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="beyond"><a href="beyond.html">Beyond</a></h2>
		<p>The Kuiper belt, sometimes called the Edgeworth–Kuiper belt, is a region of the Solar System beyond the planets, extending from the orbit of Neptune to approximately 50 AU from the Sun.
		After that comes the Ort Cloud.The Oort cloud is thought to comprise two regions: a spherical outer Oort cloud and a disc-shaped inner Oort cloud, or Hills cloud. Objects in the Oort cloud are largely
		composed of ices, such as water, ammonia, and methane. And then we have the heliosphere which is like a bubble shield for the sun against interstellar radiation</p>

Pluto is the only dwarf planet to once have been considered a major planet. Once thought of as the ninth planet and 
the one most distant from the sun, Pluto is now seen as one of the largest known members of the Kuiper Belt, a 
shadowy disk-like zone beyond the orbit of Neptune populated by a trillion or more comets. 
</p>


<p id="p1">
Pluto's surface is one of the coldest places in the solar system at roughly minus 375 degrees 
F (minus 225 degrees C). For a long time, astronomers knew little about its surface because of its distance 
from Earth, but more is coming, bit by bit, with the Hubble Space Telescope returning images of a planet that
 appears reddish, yellowish and grayish in places, with a curious bright spot near the equator that might be rich 
 in carbon monoxide frost. 
</p>

<p id="p1">
Pluto's highly elliptical orbit can take it more than 49 times as far out from the sun as Earth. 
It actually gets closer to the sun than Neptune for 20 years out of Pluto's 248-Earth-years-long orbit,
 providing astronomers a rare chance to study this small, cold, distant world. So after 20 years as the eighth 
 
 planet (in order going out from the sun), in 1999, Pluto crossed Neptune's orbit to become the farthest planet
 from the sun (until it was demoted to the status of dwarf planet).
</p>

<p id="p1">
Composition & structure

<br>Atmospheric composition:</br> Methane, nitrogen

<br>Magnetic field: </br>It remains unknown whether Pluto has a magnetic field, but its small size and slow rotation suggest it has little to none.

<br>Chemical composition:</br> Probably a mixture of 70 percent rock and 30 percent water ice.

<br>Internal structure: </br>Probably a rocky core surrounded by a mantle of water ice, with more exotic ices such as methane and nitrogen frost coating its surface.
</p>

<p id="p1">
<br>Average distance from the sun:</br> 3,670,050,000 miles (5,906,380,000 km) — 39.482 times that of Earth

<br>Perihelion (closest approach to the sun):</br> 2,756,902,000 miles (4,436,820,000 km) — 30.171 times that of Earth

<br>Aphelion (farthest distance from the sun): </br>4,583,190,000 miles (7,375,930,000 km) — 48.481 times that of Earth
</p>

<p id="p1">
<br>Some facts about Pluto</br>
Pluto is named after the Greek god of the underworld.
This is a later name for the more well known Hades and was proposed by Venetia Burney an eleven year old schoolgirl from Oxford, England.

Pluto was reclassified from a planet to a dwarf planet in 2006.
This is when the IAU formalised the definition of a planet as “A planet is a celestial body that (a) is in orbit around the Sun, (b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, and (c) has cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit.”

Pluto was discovered on February 18th, 1930 by the Lowell Observatory.
For the 76 years between Pluto being discovered and the time it was reclassified as a dwarf planet it completed under a third of its orbit around the Sun.

Pluto has five known moons.
They are Charon (discovered in 1978,), Hydra and Nix (both discovered in 2005), Kerberos originally P4 (discovered 2011) and Styx originally P5 (discovered 2012) official designations S/2011 (134340) 1 and  S/2012 (134340) 1.

Pluto may be the largest dwarf planet.
Or it could be Eris. Currently the most accurate measurements give Eris an average diameter of 2,326km with a margin of error of 12km, while Pluto’s diameter is 2,368km with a 20km margin of error, however due to Pluto’s atmosphere it is difficult to say for certain.
Pluto is one third water.
This is in the form of water ice which is more than 3 times as much water as in all the Earth’s oceans, the remaining two thirds are rock.
