		<p>The Sun is a star, a hot ball of glowing gases at the heart of our solar system. Its influence extends far beyond the orbits of distant Neptune and Pluto.

		<p>The Sun is a star, a hot ball of glowing gases at the heart of our solar system. Its influence extends far beyond the orbits of distant Neptune and Pluto. Without the Sun's intense energy and heat, there would be no life on Earth. And though it is special to us, there are billions of stars like our Sun scattered across the Milky Way galaxy.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="mercury">Mercury</h2>
		<p>Sun-scorched Mercury is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon. Like the Moon, Mercury has very little atmosphere to stop impacts and it is covered with craters. Mercury's dayside is super heated by the Sun, but at night temperatures drop hundreds of degrees below freezing. Ice may even exist in craters. Mercury's egg-shaped orbit takes it around the Sun every 88 days.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="venus">Venus</h2>
		<p>Venus is a dim world of intense heat and volcanic activity. Similar in structure and size to Earth, Venus' thick, toxic atmosphere traps heat in a runaway 'greenhouse effect.' The scorched world has temperatures hot enough to melt lead. Glimpses below the clouds reveal volcanoes and deformed mountains. Venus spins slowly in the opposite direction of most planets.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="earth">Earth</h2>
		<p>Earth is an ocean planet. Our home world's abundance of water - and life - makes it unique in our solar system. Other planets, plus a few moons, have ice, atmospheres, seasons and even weather, but only on Earth does the whole complicated mix come together in a way that encourages life - and lots of it.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="mars">Mars</h2>
		<p>Though details of Mars' surface are difficult to see from Earth, telescope observations show seasonally changing features and white patches at the poles. For decades, people speculated that bright and dark areas on Mars were patches of vegetation, that Mars could be a likely place for life-forms, and that water might exist in the polar caps. When the Mariner 4 spacecraft flew by Mars in 1965, many were shocked to see photographs of a bleak, cratered surface. Mars seemed to be a dead planet. Later missions, however, have shown that Mars is a complex member of the solar system and holds many mysteries yet to be solved.</p>

		<h2 id="asteroid belt">Asteroid Belt</h2>
		<p></p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="jupiter">Jupiter</h2>
		<p>The most massive planet in our solar system, with four large moons and many smaller moons, Jupiter forms a kind of miniature solar system. Jupiter resembles a star in composition. In fact, if it had been about 80 times more massive, it would have become a star rather than a planet.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="saturn">Saturn</h2>
		<p>Saturn was the most distant of the five planets known to the ancients. Like Jupiter, Saturn is made mostly of hydrogen and helium. Its volume is 755 times greater than that of Earth. Winds in the upper atmosphere reach 500 meters (1,600 feet) per second in the equatorial region. These super-fast winds, combined with heat rising from within the planet's interior, cause the yellow and gold bands visible in the atmosphere.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="uranus">Uranus</h2>
		<p>The first planet found with the aid of a telescope, Uranus was discovered in 1781 by astronomer William Herschel. The seventh planet from the Sun is so distant that it takes 84 years to complete one orbit.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="neptune">Neptune</h2>
		<p>Nearly 4.5 billion kilometers (2.8 billion miles) from the Sun, Neptune orbits the Sun once every 165 years. It is invisible to the naked eye because of its extreme distance from Earth. Interestingly, the unusual elliptical orbit of the dwarf planet Pluto brings Pluto inside Neptune's orbit for a 20-year period out of every 248 Earth years</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="pluto">Pluto</h2>
		<p>Tiny, cold and incredibly distant, Pluto was discovered in 1930 and long considered to be the ninth planet. But after the discoveries of similar intriguing worlds even farther out, Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet. This new class of worlds may offer some of the best evidence of the origins of our solar system.</p>

	   <h4 id="pointer"> What is a star?</h4>
	   
        <p>

A star is a huge sphere of very hot, glowing gas. Stars produce their own light 
and energy by a process called nuclear fusion. Fusion happens when lighter elements 
are forced to become heavier elements. When this happens, a tremendous amount of
 energy is created causing the star to heat up and shine. Stars come in a variety 
of sizes and colors. Our Sun is an average sized yellowish star. Stars which are 
smaller than our Sun are reddish and larger stars are blue.
</p>
</div>

<div class = "solar" id="solar">
<h4 id="pointer">Main Sequence Star<h4>

<p>
When a star begins to form, matter clumps together making it denser. At some point when
the temperature is over 8 million degrees celcius the kinetic energy of hydrogen gas at 
the core is so much that the the nuclie tend to fuse together to balance the gravitational
collapse of the star. 

Millions of years later, the star is stable enough because the outward radiation create
by the fusion of hydrogen into helium in  the will balance the gravitational forces
of the star trying to collapse in on itself. 
At this point it is called a main sequence star.

</p>
</div>

<div class = "solar" id="solar">
<h4 id="pointer">Red Giant<h4>
<p>


A star in its last stages of life or stellar evolution is called a red giant. A high
frequency of the stars in the universe are main sequence stars, which means they convert
hydrogen to helium through nuclear fusion just like our sun. 

Due to the outward pressure from fusion against the inward pressure of gravity, the star
is balanced. But when the star runs out of hydrogen, this is when the star starts to
compress. The temperature increases with contraction and the helium starts to combine
with carbon. Based on the mass of the star, this helium might burn slowly or might go off
with an exposive bang. The amount of energy produced by the star through helium fusion
will cause the star to expand to a size much bigger than its original size. They can range 
from 100 million to a billion kilometers in diameter which is 100 to 1000 times bigger 
than our sun. But as they grow they become cooler because the energy consumed is more because
it spread across the entire surface area. The change in temperature makes them glow red and hence 
they were given the name red giant.

</p>
</div>

<div class = "solar" id="solar">
<h4 id="pointer">White Dwarf<h4>

<p>


When a star runs out of hydrogen to fuse with helium, helium starts to fuse with carbon and the star
tends to contract or blow outward. If it collapses, a white dwarf is formed. The weight of this star
is about the mass of the sun but its radius is about that of the earth, which makes it really dense. 
The gravity would be about 350,000 times that of Earth. The reason for their density is because
their electrons are smashed together. These electrons have to squeeze together tightly 
to create an outward pressure. But sheding so much mass during its red giant phase,
no white dwarf can exceed 1.4 times the mass of the sun
</p>
</div>

<div class = "solar" id="solar">
<h4 id="pointer">Neutron Star<h4>

<p>


Neutron stars are about 1.4 times that of the sun. Born out of an exploding larger
star. When a star goes supernova, their outer layer blows off leaving behind a dense core that 
still continues to collapse. The gravity on these sort of stars is almost 2 billion times that
of the earth. A teaspoon would weight a billion tons. Neutron stars have an extremely quick rotation, spinning 
several times a second. They can spin at rates of 43,000 times per minute, slowing down over time.


</p>
</div>


<div class = "solar" id="solar">

<h4 id="pointer">Black hole<h4>
<p>
Black hole
Black holes are some of the strangest and most fascinating objects found in outer 
space. They are objects of extreme density, with such strong gravitational attraction that even light 
cannot escape from their grasp if it comes near enough.

When a star burns through the last of its fuel, it could collapse. For smaller stars
, up to three times the sun's mass, the new core will be a neutron star or a white dwarf. But when a larger star collapses,
it continues to fall in on itself to create a stellar black hole.

Small black holes populate the universe, but their cousins, supermassive black
holes, dominate. Supermassive black holes are millions or even billions of times 
as massive as the sun, but have a radius similar to that of Earth's closest star.
 Such black holes are thought to lie at the center of pretty much every galaxy, 
including the Milky Way.
