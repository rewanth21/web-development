		<p>The Sun is a star, a hot ball of glowing gases at the heart of our solar system. Its influence extends far beyond the orbits of distant Neptune and Pluto. Without the Sun's intense energy and heat, there would be no life on Earth. And though it is special to us, there are billions of stars like our Sun scattered across the Milky Way galaxy.</p>

		<p>The Sun is a star, a hot ball of glowing gases at the heart of our solar system. Its influence extends far beyond the orbits of distant Neptune and Pluto. Without the Sun's intense energy and heat, there would be no life on Earth. And though it is special to us, there are billions of stars like our Sun scattered across the Milky Way galaxy.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="mercury"><a href="mercury.html">Mercury</a></h2>
		<p>Sun-scorched Mercury is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon. Like the Moon, Mercury has very little atmosphere to stop impacts and it is covered with craters. Mercury's dayside is super heated by the Sun, but at night temperatures drop hundreds of degrees below freezing. Ice may even exist in craters. Mercury's egg-shaped orbit takes it around the Sun every 88 days.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="venus"><a href="venus.html">Venus</a></h2>
		<p>Venus is a dim world of intense heat and volcanic activity. Similar in structure and size to Earth, Venus' thick, toxic atmosphere traps heat in a runaway 'greenhouse effect.' The scorched world has temperatures hot enough to melt lead. Glimpses below the clouds reveal volcanoes and deformed mountains. Venus spins slowly in the opposite direction of most planets.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="earth"><a href="earth.html">Earth</a></h2>
		<p>Earth is an ocean planet. Our home world's abundance of water - and life - makes it unique in our solar system. Other planets, plus a few moons, have ice, atmospheres, seasons and even weather, but only on Earth does the whole complicated mix come together in a way that encourages life - and lots of it.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="mars"><a href="mars.html">Mars</a></h2>
		<p>Though details of Mars' surface are difficult to see from Earth, telescope observations show seasonally changing features and white patches at the poles. For decades, people speculated that bright and dark areas on Mars were patches of vegetation, that Mars could be a likely place for life-forms, and that water might exist in the polar caps. When the Mariner 4 spacecraft flew by Mars in 1965, many were shocked to see photographs of a bleak, cratered surface. Mars seemed to be a dead planet. Later missions, however, have shown that Mars is a complex member of the solar system and holds many mysteries yet to be solved.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="asteroid belt">Asteroid Belt</h2>
		<p>The asteroid belt is the region of the Solar System located roughly between the orbits of the planets Mars and Jupiter. It is occupied by numerous irregularly shaped bodies called asteroids or minor planets.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="jupiter"><a href="jupiter.html">Jupiter</a></h2>
		<p>The most massive planet in our solar system, with four large moons and many smaller moons, Jupiter forms a kind of miniature solar system. Jupiter resembles a star in composition. In fact, if it had been about 80 times more massive, it would have become a star rather than a planet.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="saturn"><a href="saturn.html">Saturn</a></h2>
		<p>Saturn was the most distant of the five planets known to the ancients. Like Jupiter, Saturn is made mostly of hydrogen and helium. Its volume is 755 times greater than that of Earth. Winds in the upper atmosphere reach 500 meters (1,600 feet) per second in the equatorial region. These super-fast winds, combined with heat rising from within the planet's interior, cause the yellow and gold bands visible in the atmosphere.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="uranus"><a href="uranus.html">Uranus</a></h2>
		<p>The first planet found with the aid of a telescope, Uranus was discovered in 1781 by astronomer William Herschel. The seventh planet from the Sun is so distant that it takes 84 years to complete one orbit.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="neptune"><a href="Neptune.html">Neptune</a></h2>
		<p>Nearly 4.5 billion kilometers (2.8 billion miles) from the Sun, Neptune orbits the Sun once every 165 years. It is invisible to the naked eye because of its extreme distance from Earth. Interestingly, the unusual elliptical orbit of the dwarf planet Pluto brings Pluto inside Neptune's orbit for a 20-year period out of every 248 Earth years</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="pluto"><a href="pluto.html">Pluto</a></h2>
		<p>Tiny, cold and incredibly distant, Pluto was discovered in 1930 and long considered to be the ninth planet. But after the discoveries of similar intriguing worlds even farther out, Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet. This new class of worlds may offer some of the best evidence of the origins of our solar system.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="beyond"><a href="beyond.html">Beyond</a></h2>
		<p>The Kuiper belt, sometimes called the Edgeworth–Kuiper belt, is a region of the Solar System beyond the planets, extending from the orbit of Neptune to approximately 50 AU from the Sun.
		After that comes the Ort Cloud.The Oort cloud is thought to comprise two regions: a spherical outer Oort cloud and a disc-shaped inner Oort cloud, or Hills cloud. Objects in the Oort cloud are largely
		composed of ices, such as water, ammonia, and methane. And then we have the heliosphere which is like a bubble shield for the sun against interstellar radiation</p>

<br>What is an Asteroid?</br>
Asteroids are small, rocky solar system bodies that populate interplanetary space out to the orbit of Jupiter.
 There are millions of them, and they are often grouped by their composition. The planetary science community refers to them as minor planets, 
 a general term applied to solar system bodies smaller than moons. Asteroids are mainly made of materials left over from the formation of 
 the inner solar system words. Most of them orbit the Sun between Mars and Jupiter, although there are groups of them that orbit closer.
	 
<p id="p1">
<br>What is the Asteroid Belt?</br>
Majority of the asteroids in the solar system are found in a region of the solar system
beyond mars. They form the Asteroid Belt. Others orbit in near-Earth space and a few migrate or are 
thrown out to the outer solar system by gravitational interactions. The four largest asteroids in the belt 
are Ceres, Vesta, Pallas, and Hygiea. They contain half the mass of the entire belt. The rest of the mass is
 contained in countless smaller bodies. There was a theory once that if you combined all the asteroids they
 would make up the missing “Fifth” rocky planet. Planetary scientists estimate that if you could put all that 
 material together that exists there today, it would make a tiny world smaller than Earth’s moon.
</p>

<p id="p1">
<br>Where is it located?</br>
The Asteroid Belt is located in an area of space between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. 
That places it between 2.2 and 3.2 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun. The belt is about 1 AU thick. 
The average distance between objects in the Asteroid Belt is quite large. If you could stand on an asteroid 
and look around, the next one would be too far away to see very well.
</p>


<p id="p1">
<br>What is the belt made of?</br>
Asteroid Belt objects are made of rock and stone. Some are solid objects, while others are orbiting “rubble piles”.
 The Asteroid Belt contains billions and billions of asteroids.
Some asteroids in the Belt are quite large, but most range in size down to pebbles.
The asteroid 1/Ceres is also designated as a dwarf planet, the largest one in the inner solar system.
We know of at least 7,000 asteroids.
The Asteroid Belt may contain many objects, but they are spread out over a huge area of space. This has allowed spacecraft to move through this region without hitting anything.
Asteroids get their names from suggestions by their discoverers and are also given a number.
 The formation of Jupiter disrupted the formation of any worlds in the Asteroid Belt region by scattering asteroids away. This caused them to collide and break into smaller pieces.
Gravitational influences can move asteroids out of the Belt.
The Asteroid Belt is often referred to as the “Main Belt” to distinguish it from other groups of asteroids such as the Lagrangians and Centaurs.
