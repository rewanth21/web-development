		<h2 id="solar system"><a href="homepage.html">Solar System</a></h2>
		<p>A solar system refers to a star and all the objects that travel in orbit around it. Our solar system consists of the sun - our star - eight planets and their natural satellites (such as our moon); dwarf planets; asteroids and comets. Our solar system is located in an outward spiral of the Milky Way galaxy.</p>
		</li>
	
	
		<li>
		<h2 id="sun"><a href="Sun.html">Sun</a></h2>
		<p>The Sun is a star, a hot ball of glowing gases at the heart of our solar system. Its influence extends far beyond the orbits of distant Neptune and Pluto. Without the Sun's intense energy and heat, there would be no life on Earth. And though it is special to us, there are billions of stars like our Sun scattered across the Milky Way galaxy.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="mercury"><a href="mercury.html">Mercury</a></h2>
		<p>Sun-scorched Mercury is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon. Like the Moon, Mercury has very little atmosphere to stop impacts and it is covered with craters. Mercury's dayside is super heated by the Sun, but at night temperatures drop hundreds of degrees below freezing. Ice may even exist in craters. Mercury's egg-shaped orbit takes it around the Sun every 88 days.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="venus">Venus</h2>
		<p>Venus is a dim world of intense heat and volcanic activity. Similar in structure and size to Earth, Venus' thick, toxic atmosphere traps heat in a runaway 'greenhouse effect.' The scorched world has temperatures hot enough to melt lead. Glimpses below the clouds reveal volcanoes and deformed mountains. Venus spins slowly in the opposite direction of most planets.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="earth"><a href="earth.html">Earth</a></h2>
		<p>Earth is an ocean planet. Our home world's abundance of water - and life - makes it unique in our solar system. Other planets, plus a few moons, have ice, atmospheres, seasons and even weather, but only on Earth does the whole complicated mix come together in a way that encourages life - and lots of it.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="mars"><a href="mars.html">Mars</a></h2>
		<p>Though details of Mars' surface are difficult to see from Earth, telescope observations show seasonally changing features and white patches at the poles. For decades, people speculated that bright and dark areas on Mars were patches of vegetation, that Mars could be a likely place for life-forms, and that water might exist in the polar caps. When the Mariner 4 spacecraft flew by Mars in 1965, many were shocked to see photographs of a bleak, cratered surface. Mars seemed to be a dead planet. Later missions, however, have shown that Mars is a complex member of the solar system and holds many mysteries yet to be solved.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="asteroid belt"><a href="asteroidbelt.html">Asteroid Belt</a></h2>
		<p>The asteroid belt is the region of the Solar System located roughly between the orbits of the planets Mars and Jupiter. It is occupied by numerous irregularly shaped bodies called asteroids or minor planets.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="jupiter"><a href="jupiter.html">Jupiter</a></h2>
		<p>The most massive planet in our solar system, with four large moons and many smaller moons, Jupiter forms a kind of miniature solar system. Jupiter resembles a star in composition. In fact, if it had been about 80 times more massive, it would have become a star rather than a planet.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="saturn"><a href="saturn.html">Saturn</a></h2>
		<p>Saturn was the most distant of the five planets known to the ancients. Like Jupiter, Saturn is made mostly of hydrogen and helium. Its volume is 755 times greater than that of Earth. Winds in the upper atmosphere reach 500 meters (1,600 feet) per second in the equatorial region. These super-fast winds, combined with heat rising from within the planet's interior, cause the yellow and gold bands visible in the atmosphere.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="uranus"><a href="uranus.html">Uranus</a></h2>
		<p>The first planet found with the aid of a telescope, Uranus was discovered in 1781 by astronomer William Herschel. The seventh planet from the Sun is so distant that it takes 84 years to complete one orbit.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="neptune"><a href="Neptune.html">Neptune</a></h2>
		<p>Nearly 4.5 billion kilometers (2.8 billion miles) from the Sun, Neptune orbits the Sun once every 165 years. It is invisible to the naked eye because of its extreme distance from Earth. Interestingly, the unusual elliptical orbit of the dwarf planet Pluto brings Pluto inside Neptune's orbit for a 20-year period out of every 248 Earth years</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="pluto"><a href="pluto.html">Pluto</a></h2>
		<p>Tiny, cold and incredibly distant, Pluto was discovered in 1930 and long considered to be the ninth planet. But after the discoveries of similar intriguing worlds even farther out, Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet. This new class of worlds may offer some of the best evidence of the origins of our solar system.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
		<h2 id="Beyond"><a href="beyond.html">Beyond</a></h2>
		<p>The Kuiper belt, sometimes called the Edgeworth–Kuiper belt, is a region of the Solar System beyond the planets, extending from the orbit of Neptune to approximately 50 AU from the Sun.
		After that comes the Ort Cloud.The Oort cloud is thought to comprise two regions: a spherical outer Oort cloud and a disc-shaped inner Oort cloud, or Hills cloud. Objects in the Oort cloud are largely
		composed of ices, such as water, ammonia, and methane. And then we have the heliosphere which is like a bubble shield for the sun against interstellar radiation</p>

Venus, the second planet from the sun, named for the Roman goddess of love and beauty. 
The planet — the only planet named after a female — may have been named for the most beautiful deity of her 
pantheon because it shone the brightest of the five planets known to ancient astronomers.
In ancient times, Venus was thought to be two different stars, the evening star and the morning star — 
that is, the ones that first appeared at sunset and sunrise. 
 
</p>

       <p id="p1">

 Even though venus is not the closest planet to the sun, it is considered to be the hottest world in the solar 
 system because its dense atmosphere traps heat which in turn forms a runaway greenhouse effect and due to this its
 temperature soars to 465 deg Celcius. Over the years, there have been a few probes
 that have landed on Venus which only managed to survive for a few hours.
</p>


       <p id="p1">
Venus and Earth are often called twins because they are similar in size, mass, density, composition and gravity. 
Venus is the hottest world in the solar system. Although Venus is not the planet closest to the sun, its dense 
atmosphere traps heat in a runaway version of the greenhouse effect that warms Earth. As a result, temperatures 
on Venus reach 870 degrees Fahrenheit (465 degrees Celsius), more than hot enough to melt lead.
The atmosphere of Venus is made up almost completely of carbon dioxide. Nitrogen exists in small doses, as do 
clouds of sulfuric acid. The air of Venus is so dense that the small traces of nitrogen are four times the amount 
found on Earth, although nitrogen makes up more than three-fourths of the terrestrial atmosphere. This composition 
causes a runaway greenhouse effect that heats the planet even hotter than the surface of Mercury, although Venus 
lies farther from the sun. When the rocky core of Venus formed, it captured much of the gas gravitationally.
Although Venus and Earth are similar in size, someone standing on the ground on Venus would experience air about 
90 times heavier than Earth's atmosphere; pressures are similar to diving 3,000 feet beneath the ocean. Ironically, 
the most Earth-like atmosphere in the solar system occurs 30 to 40 miles (50 to 60 kilometers) above the surface of Venus.
 Both oxygen and hydrogen rise above the heavier gas layer covering the ground, and the pressures are similar to our planet.
The Venusian year — the time it takes to orbit the sun — is about 225 Earth days long. Normally, that would mean 
that days on Venus would be longer than years. However, because of Venus' curious retrograde rotation, the time 
from one sunrise to the next is only about 117 Earth days long. 
 
</p>


      <p id="p1">
<br>Atmospheric composition (by volume) and Internal structure:</br> 
96.5 percent carbon dioxide, 3.5 percent nitrogen, with minor amounts of sulfur dioxide, argon, water, carbon monoxide, helium and neon.
 Venus' metallic iron core is roughly 2,400 miles (6,000 km) wide. Venus' molten rocky mantle is roughly 1,200 miles (3,000 km) thick. 
 Venus' crust is mostly basalt, and is estimated to be six to 12 miles (10 to 20 km) thick on average.
</p>


       <p id="p1">

 <br>Average distance from the sun:</br> 
 67,237,910 miles (108,208,930 km). By comparison: 0.723 times that of Earth

<br>Perihelion (closest approach to sun):</br> 
66,782,000 miles (107,476,000 km). By comparison: 0.730 times that of Earth

<br>Aphelion (farthest distance from sun):</br> 
67,693,000 miles (108,942,000 km). By comparison: 0.716 times that of Earth
</p>

 

       <p id="p1">
<br id="b1">Interesting facts about Venus</br>
<br>Venus rotates counter-clockwise.
Also known as retrograde rotation. A possible reason might be a collision in the past with an asteroid or other object that caused the planet to
alter its rotational path. It also differs from most other planets in our solar system by having no natural satellites.
</br>
<br>Venus is the second brightest object in the night sky.
Only the Moon is brighter. With a magnitude of between -3.8 to -4.6 Venus is so bright it can be seen during daytime on a clear day.
 </br>
 <br id="b1">The Russians sent the first mission to Venus.
The Venera 1 space probe was launched in 1961, but lost contact with base. The USA also lost their first probe to Venus, Mariner 1,
 although Mariner 2 was able to take measurements of the planet in 1962. The Soviet Union’s Venera 3 was the first man-made craft to land on Venus in 1966.
</br>
<br>At one point it was thought Venus might be a tropical paradise.
The dense clouds of sulphuric acid surrounding Venus make it impossible to view its surface from outside its atmosphere. It was only when
 radio mapping was developed in the 1960s that scientists were able to observe and measure the extreme temperatures and hostile environment.
 It is thought Venus did once have oceans but these evaporated as the planets temperature increased.
